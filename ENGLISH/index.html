            <p>Mankind has been researching the key to a long and healthy life for a long time.
                The world of science is moving forward unbroken to move both the length and quality of human life forward in a
                positive direction.</p>
            <p>Millions of dollars and nearly twenty years have been invested in research in an area that the scientific world has so
                far neglected. </p>
            <p>Researchers have achieved a wonderful breakthrough in a certain field of science in observing the working
                principle of “REDOX SIGNALING MOLECULES”. They discovered something we knew nothing about before. They solved what cell
                function is at the molecular level.</p>
            <p>Not only they observed what the function of the cell was at the molecular level, but, like the human cell, they were able
                to produce the Redox Signaling Molecules exactly the same as produced in the cell.</p>
            <p>All of this is such big a breakthrough that scientists and doctors have not encountered since penicillin was produced.</p>
            <p>This technology is also special because, although Redox Signaling Molecules are only viable in the human body for a
                fraction of a second, scientists have managed to stabilize them in a biologically active form in a bottle to
                deliver to humans in an edible form.</p>

            harmful lifestyles, such as air pollution, excessive sun exposure, malnutrition,

          <p>Dr. Gary L. Samuelson, a doctor and atomic medical physicist, an expert in
            the field, says all diseases can be traced back to diseased cells. Not just a
            certain percentage of them, but all diseases. If someone wants a healthy
            heart, they will need healthy heart cells, if they want a healthy brain, then
            healthy brain cells, if they want a healthy lung, then healthy lung cells. To
            understand this, we need to think at the cellular level.</p>
          <p class="d-none d-lg-block">Think about it, a
            severed finger will heal or we will recover from a cold. And in this, the

      </div>
      <p class="mt-lg-4 pl-xl-5 pr-xl-5 ml-xl-5 mr-xl-5 text-center text-md-left">Once you have searched for the damaged cells, there are two options. If
        there is a minor degree of damage to the cell, it will repair it. However, if the
        cell is already too damaged to be repaired, it is destroyed and the
        surrounding healthy cells produce a new cell instead. Scientists have
        observed that these processes are controlled by Redox Signal Molecules,
        without which we could not live.</p>
      <p class="mt-lg-4 pl-xl-5 pr-xl-5 ml-xl-5 mr-xl-5 text-center text-md-left">So Redox Signal Molecules can be the key
        to life, as millions of cells are born and destroyed in us every minute.</p>

                            in addition to energy, the mitochondria also produce two different types of
                            Redox Signaling Molecules. One of these is the antioxidant activator and the
                            other is the immune system communicator. It has long been believed that
                            these molecules are only by-products of the energy-producing processes of

                          <p>Most people have heard of the beneficial role of antioxidants, so they take a
                            handful to protect them from harmful free radicals and to protect their cells
                            from various damage. However, few people know that it does not matter
                            how much antioxidant they bring into their body, but how much is absorbed
                            at the cellular level, that is, how much is utilized. However, antioxidants are
                            completely useless until they are activated by Redox Signaling Molecules. (A
                            simple example: The light bulb is the antioxidant and the Redox Signal
                            Molecule is the electric current. If there is a power outage in the apartment,
                            we don’t rush to the electrical store to buy another light bulb as there is
                            nothing to turn it on.) ASEA can increase the activity and utilization of
                            antioxidants with 500% !, thus providing our cells with more effective
                            protection against damage.

                            Redox Signaling Molecules allow this cellular communication to work
                            smoothly. Cells are constantly exchanging information with each other and
                            with the immune system as well. They report to each other on their
                            condition, longevity, instruct each other to defend and self-destruct. The
                            development of diseases in most cases depends on faulty or incomplete
                            cellular communication. For example, if a cell is damaged and a sufficient
                            amount of Redox Signal Molecule is produced in the body, the diseased cell is
                            repaired or destroyed and replaced with a new cell. If any fault slips into this
                            communication machine, the damaged cell will begin to copy itself. It also
                            leads to harmful tissue proliferation (commonly called cancer), various organ
                            damage, and other degenerative lesions. Redox Signaling Molecules is life

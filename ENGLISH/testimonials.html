              <p>2020  Update - I have just had my latest skin check and I STILL have no issues with my skin.
                To me that is incredible because for years before I started ASEA & Renu 28 I was constantly having
                things removed or having to use some horrible cream treatments that were just not working!
                Truly grateful for ASEA!❤</p>
            <p>2015 - I have suffered from a skin issue caused by the sun for many years and have had many surgery's on my face, arms, legs back and chest. I have used two different types of medical creams that have caused the issues you can see in the photos. The first photo was from my last treatment in 2015 and the last photo was taken today.  I started using the Renu 28 gel in 2015 just after the first first photo was taken and my skin has improved beyond belief and the decrease in wrinkles has been an added surprise. 
                For the first time in many years I do not have anything on my face that needs to be removed!  
                I use Renu 28 twice a day and sometimes the serum.
                I started drinking ASEA about 18 months ago. 
                I have to say I feel 20 years younger than I did and many other health challenges have improved.
                Thank you ASEA. — with Nita Beth Gibbs and 6 others.</p>

              <p>UPDATE from Dennay Denney— <br>I am struggling to find the right words to describe what has happened.
                On Saturday I had another PET scan to see if things had stabilized or gotten worse. Monday a Nurse
                Practitioner called me. Pete answered the phone because I had a feeling it was someone calling from
                the hospital, and in that moment I wasn’t prepared to hear.  The next thing I know she is saying
                that she called to tell us the good news about my scan. Wait, did she just say GOOD NEWS? Then she
                says that my liver has gone from 10 active abnormal cell growths down to ONE. All of the
                active/rogue cells lymph nodes in my lungs, chest, neck, and arms: ALL COMPLETELY RESOLVED.
                Most of the lymph nodes in my abdomen and pelvic area are almost completely gone. Only 2-3 remain
                and they are much less active or bright on the scale used to determine how dangerous they are.
                As far as my bones, the report says: Marked improvement in osseous burden. Numerous bone metastases
                have significantly decreased in rogue cell activity. Most of the bone lesions are now COMPLETELY
                INACTIVE.<br> This, my friends, is a MIRACLE. I was not even able to process all of this until
                yesterday during my office visit appointment when I finally saw the before and after scans side
                by side. Keep in mind that these scans are 3 1/2 months apart. Medically, this response does not
                make sense. Needless to say, my oncology team was astounded. Because I still could not quite
                believe what I was seeing I asked if this type of response was normal. I have only been taking
                the oral pill since Oct 20th and for the first couple weeks I took a half dose. <br> She said,
                “No, this is not normal. This is exceptional!” Pete and I could barely comprehend the images side
                by side. We were speechless and all I could think to say for a moment was “Thank you so much.”
                My oncologist looked at me and said, “Oh no, this is all you. If you had done what I suggested
                we would not be looking at these results right now. Chemical application would not have done this.”
                I have great respect for her saying those words. We were more amazed because she had previously
                told me that oral pills always take longer to work than IV treatments and that is partly why she
                was pushing chemical poison since my situation was so critical. Then I told her that I didn’t know
                what her beliefs were but that I believe that this is also the result of hundreds of people praying
                hard for me since October. She said, “Well, even if I didn’t believe it would be pretty hard to
                deny with these results! But I am a believer!” I have no doubt that God has worked all of this
                out and He has heard our prayers and our cries. There is literally no other explanation for what
                we have seen. The proof is in those side by side images. When you look at them, it is normal for
                the brain, kidneys, and bladder to light up (black). So if you remove those areas from the image
                on the right almost nothing remains from what the left image showed in October. It is truly one
                of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I am so glad that I never saw the previous scan.
                I knew it was bad, but I never could have imagined just how bad. It would have been very difficult
                to remain hopeful and not be entirely depressed if any of us had seen that image.  Now I understand
                why the oncologist kept saying that my physical appearance, lab results, and ability to walk around
                without severe pain or assistance did not match what it showed on the inside. ALL GOD. Now I
                understand why there were many days I could barely walk from one room to the other without
                complete exhaustion and why I could not breathe. Pete said to me yesterday, “Honey, you were dying.”
                And I was. Thank you, Jesus, for preserving my life and giving me more time with my family. It is
                the greatest gift. I feel GREAT. I have gained 15 pounds!! My thoughts are all over the place and
                honestly everything is still sinking in. These results are more than I could have imagined. The
                faith and prayers of our family and friends have carried me through even when my own could not.
                I was trying to figure out how to prepare myself to die. I had faith, and my hope is in God, but
                I also knew the reality of my situation and that God would have to save my life. So while I do
                still have a few spots that remain, there is 90% improvement and I know that He will see us
                through. I know that there are people and churches as far away as Africa who have been fasting
                and praying for me and my family. There is no way I could ever express my gratitude to you all
                fully in words. You have been faithful and have fought this battle right by my side and I pray
                that you all receive immense blessings. It was seriously the best thing ever to be able to call
                my parents and give them GOOD NEWS. Such a gift. We are amazed and will continue to be grateful
                for every single day that I am given. Please continue to pray with us as I continue to fight until
                every spot is eradicated from my body! I posted a more close up image below so you can better see
                how absolutely miraculous this truly is. It’s simply stunning. Thank you Beth Yelverton Baker for
                introducing Redox to us!</p>

                I'm so excited to share my ASEA story. As I'm getting older I started noticing my hair starting to thin out and
                wanted to do something about it. So I started taking other products and nothing ever worked. I got
                frustrated and did hair restoration exactly 1 year ago in the front section of my head. I was
                scheduled to go back to do the middle and back section but after being on ASEA for 1 month and 2
                weeks I've seen a dramatic difference in hair growth. I apply renu28 2 times a day and mist ASEA
                3 times in between. I'm so excited to see what its gonna look like in the coming months😁</p>

              <p>I LOVE ASEA & RENU!!! 😁 <br> I started taking ASEA and using Renu 28 Advanced gel about two
                weeks ago to help heal my leaky gut due to candida overgrowth.</p>
            <p>I’ve had extremely dry skin on my palms for nearly 10 years (due to my gut dysbiosis). I would
                have to file my palms with a heal file to remove the rough skin and constantly used thick lotions
                to mask the dryness. I applied Renu 28 and literally hours later, my hands were nearly normal!
                When I applied lotion they were soft!!! I was shocked! 🙌  Here are before and after pics — taken
                hours apart. 😀 </p>
            <p>And do top it off, my gut is healing! 💫 I can already eat a wider variety of food, my histamine
                reactions have decreased a lot, and I don’t have fatigue after I eat like I used to (even when
                I eat a high carb meal). I still have a ways to go on my healing journey... thankfully, I’m in
                the mend.</p>
            <p>I have my life back!!! I energy again! 😊 I can work out and ride my Friesian stallion more often now.
                Before, I didn’t have the strength to get up into the saddle or even groom my stallion. I could
                barely ride or lift weights just a month ago... I’m grateful beyond expression for ASEA and Renu
                28! 👏</p>
            <p>I can hardly wait until I’m fully healed, which will be very soon, I’m sure! 💞☺️💖</p>

              <p>This young man is Brenden Nichols.  He was getting ready to start medical school; a young man
                with a whole lifetime of opportunity ahead of him. While driving to meet his dad for a hunting
                trip, he was involved in a very serious car accident in 2011. A deer ran out in front of his car,
                he swerved and rolled his vehicle. He hung upside down in his seatbelt for 4 hours while everyone
                frantically searched for him.  Brenden was in a coma for 49 days. The doctor who was caring for
                him recommended disconnecting him from life support. He told Brenden’s parents he would never live
                a productive life and would be left in a vegetative state. A physical therapist named Shawn Burke
                invited Brenden’s parents to learn about ASEA Redox.   He has battled his way back to the 
                “living” and thanks to ASEA Redox, Brenden is back in school and is living a very productive life.
                In fact, this fine young man is now our personal trainer at Shawn Burke’s gym, Foundation Fitness,
                in Coeurd’Alene, Idaho. He is helping us with our health! We know that supplementing with ASEA
                Redox molecules help the body heal itself. And Brenden is living proof of that! — with Dick Walker
                and Shawn Burke.</p>

              <p>I have worked with animals in nutrition and behavior counseling for over 25 years, and when
                I learned about ASEA from Peg Coats, I was so excited! Since meeting Peg, I have been working
                with ASEA and my animal clients for eight years. The changes and miracles have been awesome!
                My own beloved cat, Simon, was an ASEA miracle. Simon had a serious blood disease that normally
                is a death sentence within months. Simon lived with it for 15 years! ASEA, along with a species
                -appropriate diet, kept him well and happy longer than anyone, especially the vets, could believe.
                ASEA continues to bless my family and my animal clients' families. Please share it!</p>

              <p>My family has seen some amazing things and has had great success with ASEA. This is my youngest
                son who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder which caused hair loss. I gave him 1oz daily
                and then later on I added a good probiotic for a quicker result.  His doctor was amazed on how
                the hair grew back because in many cases the hair won't grow back. It's truly amazing 😉</p>

              <p>My husband has consistently for the past 10 years been having unhealthy levels of cholesterol.</p>
              <p>He has been put on daily cholesterol medications and has tried to change his diet and exercise to
                manage it but to no avail for the longest time.</p>
              <p>Until he started taking ASEA molecules starting 3 March 2020.</p>
              <p>For the first time in his life, his cholesterol is lower than 6mmol/L.</p>
              <p>Considering the fact that He added ASEA (60ml day and night) into his daily routine,
                ate more vegetables and exercised 2x a week.</p>

              <p>Good afternoon!<br> My name is Nina and I was was introduced to ASEA by a friend of my mom's
                who knew I was suffering from health issues that transpired into skin issues.</p>
            <p>For approximately 5 years I've been suffering with skin rashes but it didn't affect my energy level
                until this last year. The rashes have been all over my body but traveled to my neck and face
                starting in April of last year.</p>
            <p>That's when I noticed I was feeling lethargic and cloudy like brain fog. After MANY visits to the
                doctor with NO blood work (at first) they would prescribe only topical ointments. I finally was
                given bloodwork at the urging of the ER Dr., because of the butterfly rash on my face who thought
                it might be an autoimmune disorder. The bloodwork came back negative, everything.</p>
            <p>So finally this spring, I was urged to see a naturopath who tested me and found a tick borne illness.
                Not the obvious type where you get the bullseye rash or joint pain/fever. It got into my
                circulatory system and manifested into this rash which circulated all over my body.</p>
            <p>So he gave me a tincture, if you will, to rid my system of the illness. Meanwhile at the end
                of my rope with hiding and feeling horrible, I met with Cindy Molacek and she introduced my mom
                and I to ASEA. I started taking it that Thursday evening. By Sunday I could see a difference
                in the rash. It was breaking up. (Pics will show)</p>
            <p>Now I will not say it has entirely disappeared as I'm sure my tick borne illness is not yet out
                of my system, but the ASEA keeps it at bay. I still have skin flare ups but not nearly as severe
                or does not last as long. My energy is coming back as well. The Renu 28 does not work well for me
                on my acute rash but I use it on my legs for scars due to the rash.</p>
            <p>I can honestly say, I will be using this product for life. ALSO I should mention I had this rash
                in between my fingers as well, now this hurt, one spot was turning black, had lumps in it and was
                stiffening up where I couldn't straighten my finger!</p>
            <p>I sprayed the ASEA on it and within two days it was gone! I wish I would have taken pics, but I was
                skeptical and really didn't care if ASEA worked at that moment as I was so emotionally drained and
                didn't know about the product at that time. So here are my pics.</p>

              <p>I would like to share my Asea story.<br>
                I have been introduced to Asea last year this time, May 2019. I had a thyroid function problem.
                I was suffering all thyroid related issues, I had fatigue, I had no energy, I was out of breath
                after 10 minute slow walk. I had swollen ankle and feet, and my eyes were puffy. My body held back
                the water and on a rainy weekend when no excercise was done I easily put on 2kg/4-5 pounds. In fact
                every year I had put on 2kg. I also had hair loss, which I never had admitted, but yes, I had that
                too. I woke up during the night every 2 hours to go to the toilet. Could not sleep through the night
                without waking. I thought this was normal after the age of 30 and started to understand why people
                at this age would say " Oh, If I could be 20 again!".
                Up to this point we had also been trying for 7 years with my partner to have a baby together. After
                5 years trying went to see the doctor in 2017 and found out everything was okay, even our DNA, but
                my thyroid function. I went on medication to keep the thyroid function at the level that it was
                required to concieve, but for 2 years there was no success for us. I also told the doctor, that I
                noticed that sometimes my 28 day cycle is 4-5 days late, and he said this could have been a
                pregnancy already, but for some reason the body does not keep the "baby cells". He also said that
                nowadays they know, that women concieve more often than they know, half of the pregnancies are not
                carried through because even at this early age the body rejects the baby cells.
                I started using the molecules in June, and there was no cycle, of which I thought the molecules
                were working where it is needed the most, and my hormons are out of balance, which is normal at the
                age of 36. There was no cycle in July, again I thought this was normal. Finally I got a pregnancy
                test out of curiousity and it was positive. I could not believe my eyes. By the time I got to the
                first scan in August, I was already 12 weeks pregnant. 😀
                For me it means that I was already pregnant when I started Asea, and this time my body was able to
                keep the baby cells 🙂
                I had a great pregnancy and my thyroid related issues all disappeared gradually. First thing I
                noticed was my metabolism was better after 5 days. I had better sleep, and slept through the night
                on the 3rd day. No more waking to go to the toilet.
                I only put on 6 kg / 13 pounds approx during the whole pregnancy. I was able to wear my normal
                clothes up to 5 months of the pregnancy. 
                I had no cravings, of course I ate everything I wanted, but there were no crazy cravings, like
                pickles or ice cream at 2 am in the morning etc. My hair loss stopped, I did not have puffy eyes,
                my ankle and feet were not swollen any more, I had more energy. at 37 weeks I could still bend down
                to tie my shoe lace, and at 38 weeks I ran for the bus with no problems 😀
                I had an amazing pregnancy and all my thyroid related issues were gone. 
                I gave birth at the end of February to our beautiful baby boy, Maximilian. After birth my body
                recovered fast. 2 weeks after giving birth my weight was back to normal. Also my tummy was flat again.
                Not 6-pack-flat, but normal flat 🙂. Our son is nearly 4 months and I am feeling better than ever
                before. To date I am even less with 2kg than I was last year this time, before I had found out I
                was pregnant 😀
                Yes, this was my first pregnancy, so I cannot compare it with an other of my own experience, but
                comparing to the usual symptoms that mostly we can hear what women have during the pregnancy I
                strongly believe that I had such wonderful experience thanks to the molecules. I know my body,
                I would not had had such a great experience if it was not for Asea. At the age of 37 my body works
                like it was 25 🙂 Thanks to Asea and to Orsolya Ujj-Ovári and Zoltan Varnai and Anett Győrfi who
                introduced me to these amazing molecules.<br> 
                I drank 60ml/2oz in the morninng and same in the evening, still do today.</p>

              <p>I have used both the Renu 28 and the redox supplement with my own 8.5 year old golden doodle,
                Roxy.  I saw results within a few days.  Roxy had a skin infection on her back.  Last year we took
                her to the vet and the doctor gave us a cortisone cream to put on.  While it did work, the
                infection came back.  I decided to use the Renu 28 gel instead and within three days, the infection
                was gone and hasn’t come back.  Roxy had an infection on her paw.  We did the medicine route and
                then I opted to use the Renu gel while she was lying down.  I also soaked her paw in the Asea
                redox supplement. It looked much better after two days.  I also spray Asea into Roxy’s mouth to
                help her with her gums.  Asea has become our natural medicine of choice.  Not only is it healthier
                for the animal but it is much cheaper too. We all know how much the visit to the vet costs not
                including the prescribed drug.  Dogs need redox signalling molecules too to help their bodies heal
                themselves. A little goes a long way!</p>

                From Ginny’s daughter :  It started to completely clear after a month or so after using RENU28.
                But the application was not diligent so the rashes would come on and off on her legs. Will be

                <p>Toth Gergo -  I would like to share my story with you! In March 2019 I´ve had an unusual pain on the
                    left side of my neck. Normally I am not visiting the doctors with all kind of pains but because of
                    some short term bad experience – abnormal cell problems - in my very near family I have decided to
                    let it checked. I went to an otorhinolaryngologist who did not find anything and sent me for a
                    further ultrasound examination. Where I have felt the pain was actually nothing, just a flu caused
                    inflammation in the lymph nodes. BUT! The doctor found out that in the right common carotid artery
                    there is a significant - 25% - narrowing caused by fatty plaque deposits. He said that I should
                    take it really serious regarding to my age and the medical history of my family, unfortunately
                    cardiovascular problems are present in our family since generations. Carotid artery problem occurs
                    when fatty deposits (plaques) clog the blood vessels that deliver blood to our brain and head.
                    The blockage increases the risk of stroke, a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply
                    to the brain is interrupted or seriously reduced. Although there are no symptoms in the beginning
                    that is a very dangerous health issue! It was very-very woeful to face that result! We agreed in a
                    6 month check-up and regarding the result of it the kind of treatment.</p>
                <p>I´ve heard about ASEA in April 2019 for the first time and I´ve started to consume it in May the
                    recommended 2x60 ml dose daily, I applied as well Renu28 on my face occasionally. The above
                    mentioned problem was not in my mind in those days. In November when I called for the 2nd exam
                    I thought that ASEA might improve my condition. 3 weeks before the 2nd exam I raised my dose up to
                    180-240 ml per day, and I applied Renu28 3-5 times a day on that specific area on my neck.
                    The result of the 2nd ultrasound was shocking for me! The doctor asked me if I´ve had cholesterol
                    problem in spring. I said to him that not in spring and not before, my blood tests were always good.
                    He said he doesn´t understand what was in March but in that form that narrowing is not anymore
                    traceable! The good 4 mm deposit reduced so much that he defined it as a thickened artery wall and
                    he said in percentage - as a narrowing - he cannot even tell it. In the result the doctor
                    highlighted two times that this is a significant improvement! I have to check it occasionally
                    in app.1 year! I was so happy! It was very emotional for me to experience it on myself! I am so
                    grateful to have access for such an extraordinary technology!</p>

              <p>Here is my story:<br> Two years ago I had a terrible rash in my face.I also had a lack in energy and
                was off work for 7 months. No doctor could detect what it was although I was in hospital and
                thoroughly checked for everything. I tried Renu 28 and straight away had improvement. I also started
                to drink Asea and after two months I could notice a big difference. I was able to go back to 60%
                work,my skin healed fine and energy came back.Now two years later I work full time as airhostess
                and comute to another city as well. Life is good and I will never stop taking Asea or use Renu 28,
                as it really has helped me. I'm so grateful for this product that has helped me in a time of
                distress. — with Julie Watts.</p>

              <p>Kevin Ho - Below is my testimonial sharing on my immune dysfunction which is long overdue. Whatever
                I share is strictly my personal opinion and ASEA Redox is not intended to treat, cure or prevent any disease or medical
                condition. They simply empower the body to heal naturally the way it was meant to.<br> 
                In March 2013, I had a vaccination which triggered a severe immune response on my systems. I had constant pain all over my
                body especially in my brain, tingling sensations, nauseating, chronic fatigue and heart palpitations, digestive issues, leaky
                gut, elevated blood pressure.<br> 
                Between March 2013 to September 2013, I have visited 9 specialists, did Brain MRI, Heart scans, countless blood tests. Between
                October 2013 till end December 2014, I had done expensive medical procedure, IVIG immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis, all to no
                avail. I also had 20 sessions of intravenous high dose vitamin C and glutathione. I even did 30 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen
                chamber infusion.<br>
                Because mainstream science was unable to help me, I turned to alternative therapies. I have seen 2 naturopaths and 5
                Traditional Chinese Medicine physicians , went on all various detoxification, various dietary regimes and tons of supplements.
                By then, I have probably tried all sorts of supplements known to mankind ranging from nitric oxide, herbs, placenta, all
                forms of supplements including “stem cell” like supplements. I read all sorts of medical and natural healing literature making
                me a “subject matter expert” on natural healing/supplement, not by choice but a desperate need to restore my health. 
                One night in April 2017, I sat alone in my room and cried for 3 hours till I had no more tears and pleaded with the Almighty
                Universe to show me a path to get well. It has been more than 4 years and my then, I had exhausted all avenues of getting well
                and see no hope of restoring my health and waiting for the eventual ending to happen. ASK, BELIEVE and RECEIVE and 2 weeks
                later, an email connected me with Dr Wayne Pickstone in Australia and I was introduced to the Amazing Redox Signalling
                Molecules for the first time and the rest is history. Please view the video for my full account of my restoration. May
                you continue to help and impact lives with Redox Technology.</p>

              <p>Sarah Sturm 31 Aug 2018<br>
                My Mom is 89-years-old and suffered for many years with joint pain, digestive issues, and high blood pressure.</p>
              <p>Her autoimmune condition caused a lot of pain so she would go to the clinic every 6 months for infusions of a drug
                called Retuxin.  The drug helped her with the pain but compromised her immune system severely.  She would get a cold
                with congestion that would last for 6 weeks or longer.</p>
              <p>In Oct 2019, I started her on the redox molecules and within 2 months she stopped complaining of pain.  She no longer
                gets infusions and her immune response is so much better.  She’s cut one of her BP meds in ½ and her digestive issues
                have all but disappeared.</p>
              <p>After all these years of western medicine failing her, this simple drink of redox molecules helped her body reverse all
                these conditions.<br> This is a true miracle of science!</p>
              <p>It’s a wonderful feeling to know you have something that can help “turn on” the body’s ability to heal itself.
                 We’ve always known our bodies are the miracle, but as we age and continue living in a toxic world, our cells
                start to degrade more and more ...and they need help. Supplementing with redox signaling molecules gives the
                cells the tools they need to build, repair, detoxify and regenerate at a faster rate.</p>
              <p>My Mom is living a healthier, more vibrant life due to Redox Technology!<br> And I'm so happy I was the one to
                help her!</p>

              <p>This is my first post about Asea's benefits to me. Last April I was diagnosed with a joint problem and a blood problem.  My
                legs and knees hurt all the time.  I couldn't sleep. Walking hurt.  I seemed to be going downhill fast.  I started trying to
                lose weight and trying to exercise.  I had some success over the summer but I am a teacher,  and when school started I got
                busy and my health went down more and more.  I was introduced to Asea in early March.  Immediately I started noticing better
                sleep and more energy.  I had more alertness for tasks, and my mood was happy. I had two trips that required lots of walking
                soon after starting on Asea. I was struggling,  but so grateful I had something to help! Fast forward to now.... I feel
                wonderful! Not because of a great diet or exercise regimen,  because I am just now starting again on that goal,  but solely
                due to Asea, I firmly believe. My knees have stopped hurting completely! I started on a new exercise regimen this week after
                being way too sedentary all school year. I can swim again,  walk 45 minutes straight or bike for an hour.  These are all
                things I couldn't do a year ago.<br> I feel like I got my life back! Thanking God for Asea!</p>

              <p>Simone Jade - Hey Guys,<br>
                I just wanted to share a recent experience I've had with asea. I've been using it on & off for a few years but
                became more consistent the last 12 months. I found out recently that I have abnormal cells in my cervix and a
                growth on my left ovary. I've chosen to delay surgery and not do the treatment plan the Dr recommended for me and
                chose instead to work with a naturopath and utilise asea instead.<br>
                I upped my dosage to 120ml twice a day 2 months ago and now have a regular cycle and alot less cramping and pain.
                I also rub the renu28 on my abdominal area twice a day. I'm excited to see what happens there but more interesting
                is I have a deviated septum and have never been able to breath properly through my nose having consistent sinusitis
                & sinus infections.<br>
                Well the last 2 weeks my body has been releasing ridiculous amounts of a really gross mucus & phlegm. And I'm breathing
                clearly through my nose.<br>
                I don't question asea and using it with a healthier diet and lifestyle the results are truly amazing.
                If you doubt what asea can do for you I truly suggest sticking with it, the results speak for itself 🙏😊</p>

              <p>Ashley Ostler- Hello there!<br> What you are seeing is the before and after pictures of my health-story.
                My name is Ashley and I have a wonderful obligation to tell you how ASEA has been a gift in my life. My history
                is a long one but suffice it to say that it has been a challenge with a myriad of infirmities of both body and
                mind. After three rough pregnancies and the death of our middle child, I found myself physically sick and through
                medical necessity- addicted to pain medication and OTC medications. I am a type one diabetic who was struggling
                greatly with depression, PTSD, and anxiety. I was later diagnosed bi-polar. My life through these struggles, was
                not only unmanageable but was hopeless and unrecognizable from the woman I “used to be”. In 2018, after
                counseling, mental health/medication rehabilitation, came the gift of ASEA that helped me on my road to recovery. 
                I started taking ASEA in conjunction with mental counseling and out-patient services. While I am in NO way
                claiming that ASEA has “cured” me of addiction or resolved my depression, I am saying with absoluteness
                that it helped me reach out of the “fog” to get me where I am today. I am a 35 year old, functioning, mother
                of a 13 year old boy, a 10 year old daughter, and the wife of a successful medical student. What changed?
                What is the gift that ASEA gave me if it did not “heal” my deep-seeded infirmities? Well, ASEA helped me begin
                to think more clearly than I had in years! It helped revive my body, thus later, my spirit, when it came to
                increased energy, and I gained a positive desire to KEEP striving to get well as time went on. Over the last
                two years my body has begun to regain strength and vitality that I “want” to continue to foster. I “want” to
                see where I can achieve what I foresaw as the impossible. ASEA helped spur the reality that I can become well
                if I stay the course and not give up on my regimen. ASEA is not like an energy drink that produces a high that
                drops into a horrible low- but it IS like drinking “life”! My body found some balance and naturally responded
                to the significant properties that these restorative molecules supply and I felt alive again. I hope this message
                reaches the eyes and ears of of those who need hope while suffering as I have over the last 10 years. May it be
                the gift you need to carry on.</p>

              <p>Jenny Chapmen 29 March 2020<br>🙏💥PRAISE REPORT!💥🙏<br>Backstory:
                My oldest son was tested by a doctor when he was 3 years old and he found that his body did not produce very much
                glutathione. Glutathione is the main antioxidant that your body makes which aids your body in the removal of
                toxins. So we knew this was one of the reasons he would get sick often and even stay sick for 1-2 weeks when he
                was young. I found and did many things to help his body to detox in those days and we got him to a point where
                he has been much healthier with a stronger immune system response, however he still wasn't making much of his own
                glutathione. The main indicator is that he hardly ever sweats. Even after coming straight from P.E. outside when
                it feels like 110 degrees down here in South FL, his face would be beet red, however there wasn't any perspiration
                on him. 🤔😏<br> Sweating is important because it's one of the ways our bodies release toxins.</p> 
              <p>When I first learned about Asea Redox molecules and how they effectively stimulate the body to produce
                glutathione, I was excited to try this product on him. I started him on Feb 19th, 2020 at just 2 oz a day. Within
                the 1st week, he began sweating normally. He is about to turn 14 and has never needed deodorant, now he does. 😁
                After 2 weeks, I increased him to 4 oz and then 6 oz after the 3rd week. His body did experience some gentle
                detoxing the first week as he told me he had a few mild headaches and felt tired. I also started him when he had
                the flu pretty bad. Most of the house had it and were sick for a solid week. He was over the flu by day 3, so I
                do feel it helped him fight off the infection quicker.</p>
              <p> Some noticeable and positive changes:<br>
                💥He now sweats normally, such as, when we do a walk/jog or he goes out on the trampoline, he is sweating.
                Toxins are coming out!!!<br>
                💥He is sleeping better at night and waking up feeling more refreshed.<br>
                💥He is displaying more energy throughout the day. No more sluggishness!<br>
                💥He is less moody. I've seen such a good improvement in his overall mood and attitude. (This one really pleases me!!!😁)<br>
                💥We started this in the middle of "hay fever season" when he had bad allergies and the allergy meds wouldn't help him for
                more than a few hours. He hasn't needed ANY allergy medicine in the past 5 weeks.<br>
                💥He hasn't had any nose bleeds!!! He would typically get 3-4 a week. He's had 0 in the past 5 weeks.<br>
                💥We see a great improvement in his immune system already and we know it is stronger. Lack of allergy symptoms is already
                proof of this.<br> 
                💥He would complain weekly of a headache, and I always thought he was perhaps dehydrated. After his 1st week of detoxing,
                he hasn't had ANY headaches.<br>
                💥I've noticed an improvement in his attention span and focus. His teachers have already commented to me that he is more
                focused at school and his writing skills have improved.</p>  
              <p>We know healing is still taking place in his body and we are so thankful to have learned about Asea. Honestly,
                I was initially very skeptical about it and it took me many months and a lot of prayer to finally give it a try.
                I now have several family members taking Asea and they are all seeing positive changes.<br> Thank you Lord!!! 💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏</p>

                <p>Lisa Underwood 24th 2018<br> My hubby has suffered with acid reflux for a long time, so bad that I made him
                have an endoscopy before we got pregnant just to see what the damage was after years & years of suffering.
                Now after 7 months of Redox Signaling Molecules twice a day at 3oz he very rarely has an issue & if he does we
                just put Renu 28 on his neck & chest & within moments he had relief.  His dr wanted him to take a nexium everyday
                for the rest of his life 😱😱 no thank you!<br>  I’m so thankful for our safe & healthy choices. ❤️💦 — with Mike Underwood.</p>

                <p>On December 28th my wife had a surgery to remove her thyroid. A couple of days after her surgery she had a headache
                that was so severe that her doctor advised her to go to the emergency room fearing complications.</p>
                <p>An MRI showed that it wasn't a complication but instead was a brain tumor that had already eaten away
                the forehead bone and was starting to go into her brain. A follow-up visit with a neurosurgeon determined that it was
                a very aggressive tumor and would require surgery. He told us that he would have to remove all of the tissue that the
                tumor was invading and made it clear that this included perhaps part of the sagittal sinus and any other brain matter.</p>
                <p>I put this on my Facebook page and was immediately contacted by someone to put her on ASEA. I ordered a case
                for her right away and I want to add that an upline called and sent us 2 free cases of ASEA plus some of the Renew gel!!!</p>
                <p>Lara took ASEA every day for almost a month prior to the surgery.</p>
                <p>Today the neurosurgeon did the surgery and came to me afterward and said that the tumor had stopped at the
                bone and did not invade the brain tissue at all. He removed a section of her skull and made some repairs with
                a titanium mesh and did not have to remove any brain matter whatsoever!</p>
                <p>I asked him about the tumor and he said it was roughly the size of a chicken egg and that he had sent it to pathology
                to determine if it is cancerous or not but other than that he said the surgery went great and that she should be fine!</p>
                <p>I had prayed a lot and tried to have faith but I have to say I was scared. I didn't sleep really at all last
                night and held her in my arms not knowing if it was my last night with her. We are both 44 years old and I have
                known this sweet sweet beautiful woman since we were 14 years old. We have 3 young children ages 8, 6, and 4 and
                I was literally a wreck because I love her so much.</p>
                <p>I believe that the ASEA made the tumor easier to remove and stopped it from going into the brain as was shown
                in the MRI a few weeks ago. I am thankful to God for the company, the distributor who told us about it, and for the
                upline who sent the 2 free cases so that she could take as much as she needed.</p>
                <p>I have a quart with me now and am in ICU with her and giving her 2 oz doses every so many hours.</p>
                <p>I know this post is long. Thank you for letting me share with you</p><br>
                <p>One more thing, my dad had a stroke last month and today my sister told me that when she was with mom and dad a few
                days after the stroke that dad was at about a 3rd-grade level in terms of thinking and abilities. She said that he can't
                read, watch tv, bathe himself, eat without help or anything and that it is just too much for mom to be able to take care
                of him like that.</p>
                <p>I showed my sister the quart of ASEA and told her I had put dad on it about 3 weeks ago. I told her that mom called
                me yesterday and said that the nurse and physical therapist couldn't believe dad's recovery and that he is out walking,
                eating, bathing, and having conversations and thinking clearly. In other words, he is on the road to recovery and having
                amazing results that are making them scratch their heads wondering how he is recovering like that!</p>
                <p>Okay, I'm done. Thank you for letting me share these two redox experiences.🙂</p>
                <p>UPDATE 2/8/2018 - 1 day after surgery<br>We were originally told she would be in the hospital for 3 or 4 days. 
                The neurosurgeon doctor just came in and said she is doing so amazing that we get to go home!!!
                When the doctor left the room the nurse says that never happens!!! She had major brain surgery 23 hours ago. 
                <br>Thank you everyone for all the prayers and positivity!</p><br>
                <p>UPDATE 2/14/2018 - 7 days after surgery<br> It's one week since Lara's surgery. I just posted a picture of my
                Valentine below. She is doing amazing! I've been giving her 2 oz of ASEA every 3 to 5 hours during the day on
                average.</p><br>
                <p>UPDATE 5/29/2020 - a little over 2 years post-surgery<br>I wanted to thank everyone who commented on this
                post and gave us such encouraging words and positive thoughts. I wanted to let everyone know that my sweet Lara
                is doing fine! Her brain tumor never came back and she's been trying to conquer the world ever since her surgery
                a little over 2 years ago!<br> In regards to my daddy, we had another wonderful 9 months with him before he
                passed away. Those 9 months were really such a blessing to us. His mind was clear and we had so many precious
                conversations. I miss him but I am so very thankful for the extra time we were given to spend with him.
                It was quality time and you can't put a price on that!</p>
